# Higher-level programming - Python, Databases & JavaScript

## Welcome
Thank you for visiting my programming projects. This repository contains programs written for higher-level programming track in the ALX software engineering programme. In these projects, which began in the fourth month of the year one curriculum, I learned Python, MySQL and Javascript. I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting.
